# Text Detection and Recognition using EasyOCR

This repository provides a simple implementation of text detection and recognition using the EasyOCR library. With this code, you can easily extract and recognize text from images.

## Example

<img src="sign%20board.jpg" width="350" height="450">

The above image demonstrates the text detection and recognition process. The detected text regions are highlighted with bounding boxes, and the recognized text is overlaid on the image.

## Usage

1. Install the required dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
2. Replace `img_path` variable in the code with the path to your input image.
3. Run the code and observe the detected and recognized text on the output image.

Feel free to explore the code and modify it according to your needs. Happy text detection and recognition!
