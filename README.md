# Text Detection and Recognition using EasyOCR
 The "Text Detection and Recognition using EasyOCR" repository is a collection of code that demonstrates how to use the EasyOCR library for text detection and recognition in images. The code imports the necessary libraries, including OpenCV for image processing, EasyOCR for text recognition, and Matplotlib for visualization. It then reads an image, applies the text detection algorithm, and draws bounding boxes around detected text regions. The recognized text is also displayed on the image. The repository serves as a helpful resource for developers looking to implement text detection and recognition functionality using EasyOCR in their projects.
