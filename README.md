# Text Detection and Recognition using EasyOCR
 The "Text Detection and Recognition using EasyOCR" repository is a collection of code that demonstrates how to use the EasyOCR library for text detection and recognition in images. The code imports the necessary libraries, including OpenCV for image processing, EasyOCR for text recognition, and Matplotlib for visualization. It then reads an image, applies the text detection algorithm, and draws bounding boxes around detected text regions. The recognized text is also displayed on the image. The repository serves as a helpful resource for developers looking to implement text detection and recognition functionality using EasyOCR in their projects.
# Text Detection and Recognition using EasyOCR

This repository provides a simple implementation of text detection and recognition using the EasyOCR library. With this code, you can easily extract and recognize text from images.

## Example

![Example Image](example_image.jpg)

The above image demonstrates the text detection and recognition process. The detected text regions are highlighted with bounding boxes, and the recognized text is overlaid on the image.

## Usage

1. Install the required dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
2. Replace `img_path` variable in the code with the path to your input image.
3. Run the code and observe the detected and recognized text on the output image.

Feel free to explore the code and modify it according to your needs. Happy text detection and recognition!
